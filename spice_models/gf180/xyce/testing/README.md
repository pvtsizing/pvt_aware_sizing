 ```

## Prerequisites

At a minimum:

- Git 2.35+
- Python 3.6+
- Xyce 7.5+

### On Ubuntu, you can just

`apt install -y build-essential python3`

- Check this [xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/documentation-tutorials/building-guide/) for Xyce installation.

## Regression Usage

To make a full test for GF180nm models-xyce, you could use the following command in testing directory:

```bash
make all
```

- You could also check allowed targets in the Makefile, using the following command:

    ```bash
    make help
    ```

## **Regression Outputs**

- The resulting files are in `regression/<device_folder>/` with name of `<device_name><options>` that contains:

    1. A final report file of all results.
    2. measured folder that contains measured data used in regression.
    3. simulated folder that contains simulated data used in regression.
    4. netlists folder that contains spice files used in simulation.
